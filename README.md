# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Overview

This project aims to streamline the development process for React applications using Vite, a fast build tool that offers instant server start and blazing fast hot module replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience. It includes two official plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses Babel for Fast Refresh, enabling rapid updates to your React components without a full page reload.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses SWC for Fast Refresh, providing similar HMR capabilities using the SWC compiler.

By leveraging these plugins, developers can enjoy efficient development workflows with React and Vite, along with integrated ESLint rules for maintaining code quality and consistency.
